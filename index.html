        Christopher George Latore Wallace (May 21, 1972 – March 9, 1997), known professionally as The Notorious B.I.G., Biggie Smalls, or Biggie,[2] was an American rapper. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest rappers of all time.[3] The Notorious B.I.G. was noted for his "loose, easy flow"; dark, semi-autobiographical lyrics; and storytelling abilities, which focused on crime and hardship.[4]Born and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, he signed to Sean "Puffy" Combs label Bad Boy Records in 1993 and gained exposure with features on several singles the same year. His critically acclaimed debut album Ready to Die (1994), considered his magnum opus, made him a central figure in East Coast hip hop and increased New York City's visibility in the genre at a time when West Coast hip hop dominated the mainstream.[5] The following year, The Notorious B.I.G. led Junior M.A.F.I.A.—a protégé group composed of his childhood friends—to chart success.
